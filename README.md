# SIFT Keypoint Tracker
Program that detects and computes SIFT keypoints to perform object tracking across video frames. 

## Description
Uses SIFT to detect keypoints and their descriptors in individual video frames. Keypoints are then matched between frames and used to track the movement of a bounding box. 

## Executing
Running main.py executes all image reading, keypoint and descriptor computation as well as bounding box tracking. It creates two folders of visualization results.
